// (net-room.js, net-cars.js). Nothing in the menus leads here; main.js loads this module only when

//   index.html#sala=NOME     the first in a room hosts it; every pilot races the car chosen on
//                            Modo Corrida's car screen (or the one in &carro=73) if nobody else has
//                            it, else the first free one. Online, the group key opens the door and
//                            the host lets each guest in
//   &local=1                 this browser's windows only, no server; &servidor=local: wrangler dev
//   &auto=1                  the automatic pilot drives this window's car from the start
//   &fantasmas=1             (host) humans pass through each other instead of colliding
//   &lag=150&perda=5         simulate 150 ms of network delay and 5% of lost car messages
//   #sala=NOME_SEGREDO       what follows the "_" is never on screen (the card and the address bar
//                            read NOME_***): a pilot streaming his screen does not give the room away
// A guest the host lets in goes to Modo Corrida's car screen, picks its car and presses "Aguardar
// início da corrida". The host lets pilots in until the start (on the car screen, the track screen and
// on the grid; its mouse is let go on the grid when someone knocks), picks the track and presses
// Corrida única: the grid waits on 3, every waiting guest (and whoever says so meanwhile) loads it,
// and the lights go out for everyone when the host presses Largar. From then on the door waits for
// the race to end. The host's car starts at the back of the grid, as Modo Corrida's chosen car does, and the
// driver of that car sits out (the 99 races in its seat, race-roster.js fieldRoster); each guest's
// car starts in its own seat. The host's game drives the bots and passes every car on; each window
// drives its own car; the host checks guests' motion and counts their laps before relaying the
// remote cars. Every window resolves a contact for its own car only, against where it shows the other
// one; the other window does the same from its side. Modo Corrida only.
// A pilot whose line drops mid-race (or who leaves it) leaves the car with nobody at the wheel, no
// bot: it rolls on as if its driver had fainted, a stop on the road brings the tow truck to pull it
// onto the grass, and while it is on the road everyone gets the yellow flag (the card, the marshal's
// flag before it, the rivals easing off). Back in time, the pilot takes the car from where it stands;
// a car that reached the flag with nobody at the wheel is AB, its race over. The host out of reach
// (its line down, its window gone) stands the race still in every window until it is back.
